Hi moderators,
I am a developer of a reddit moderation tool called Social-Blacklist, which helps in automatic removal of posts and comments from users promoting their social links (onlyfans, Fansly etc.) in their profile, or in their posts. This is especially useful for those subreddits where their rules prohibit this. 
The tool gives you control on what areas to look for the blacklisted domains for removal of posts (Social Links section, post body, post link, or comments).

It can be installed to the subreddit by going here: 
https://developers.reddit.com/apps/social-blacklist

 If you have any questions, do let me know.



 Hi mods,
I noticed that you are using the Social-Blacklist app that I developed in your sub. I just wanted to let you know that there is presently some issue with the platform due to which it is not removing the posts that match the criteria. And due to this, it is trying to remove the same post again and again. I am following up with reddit team to have this addressed, and will inform you once it is working again.
